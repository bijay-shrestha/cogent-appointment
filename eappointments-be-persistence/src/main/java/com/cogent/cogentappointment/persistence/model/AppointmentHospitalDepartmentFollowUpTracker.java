/* TO BE A FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT:
     1. IF REMAINING NUMBER OF FOLLOW UPS IN AppointmentFollowUpTracker > 0

         ie NOW ITS 2 AND DECREMENTS TILL 0)

    2. IF FOLLOW UP REQUEST COUNT IN AppointmentFollowUpRequestLogConstant < ALLOWED numberOfFollowUps IN Hospital
    (WHEN FIRST APPOINTMENT IS APPROVED ->
        PERSIST IN AppointmentFollowUpTracker AND
        AppointmentFollowUpRequestLogConstant WITH REQUEST COUNT AS 0.
    WHEN CONSECUTIVE FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT IS TAKEN, REQUEST COUNT IS INCREMENTED BY 1 )

    3. IF REQUESTED APPOINTMENT DATE HAS NOT EXPIRED WHERE
         EXPIRY DATE = APPOINTMENT APPROVED DATE + FOLLOW UP INTERVAL DAYS (FROM Hospital)

    IF ALL THREE CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED,
